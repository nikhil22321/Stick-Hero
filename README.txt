Assumptions ->
1) The cherry will spawn on the way of the player and cherry score will only be added if and only if Player successfully pass the platform
2) If the player successfully landed on the right platform , the left platform will perform a transition of going out of the screen and there is a frame shift after that in which the right platform has come to left , the player will move to midpoint and a new platform has spawned to the right.
3) Extra score will be given only if the player succeeds to make a stick that lands to mid point of right platform and a ("Perfect!!!") message is shown , to make the game harder we didnt show the mid point of platform .
4) Player cant do flipping and we assume that once stick is made and released from vertical position no other input(Mouse click) will be given.
5) After successfully saving the game the game will automatically quit.
6) If you load saved game and you lost the saved game will not be deleted. 


Extra things added by us -> 
1) We have handled custom Save game exceptions and game initilization exceptions which will be invoked accordingly.
2) We have added junit for each class.
3) We have used strategy design pattern in it . 



Bonus -> 

1) We have added skins for the character to make the game more creative and attractive.
2) We have added sound option on home screen that will switch on/off the sound of the game. 
3) We have added tutorial on the home screen.
4) We have added different sounds like falling of character , increasing of stick etc to make it more interactive.
